This is a personal open-source project, developed on my spare time. Any contribution, suggestion, feedback or bug report is welcome.

To **suggest improvements, report a bug or any issue**, please use the [issue reporting page](https://github.com/decalage2/olefile/issues/new), providing all the information and files to reproduce the problem.

If possible please join the debugging output of olefile. For this, launch the following command :

You may also [contact the author](https://www.decalage.info/contact) directly to **provide feedback**.

The code is available in [a Git repository on GitHub](https://github.com/decalage2/olefile). You may use it to **submit enhancements** using forks and pull requests.
